# City Traffic Monitoring Project

> Monitor different sensor levels in cities and analyze the data in the cloud

This project aims to collect audio and probably air sensor data in order to gain more insights about pollution and traffic frequency. These facts should support urban citizens to get in touch with their mayors in order to request for change.

The data could be for instance

* extract vehicle noise levels depending on their type
* determine estimations for average speed values for any vehicle type
* detect any other source of "noise pollution"
* air quality data should extend pollution values

These sensor data should be forwarded to the cloud by IoT devices (re-)using sensor implementations for the demanded sensor sources.

The final goal of this project is to provide convient sensor deployment by anyone and auto-configured IoT devices to stream the data to the cloud data sink.
The data should be processed further in the cloud and stored in a database which can be accessed by a WebUI showing maps with heatmaps on top.
